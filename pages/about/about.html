                Berlin, Germany’s capital, dates to the 13th century. <BR>
                Reminders of the city's turbulent 20th-century history include its Holocaust memorial and the Berlin
                Wall's graffitied remains. <BR>
                Divided during the Cold War, its 18th-century Brandenburg Gate has become a symbol of reunification.
                <BR>
                The city's also known for its art scene and modern landmarks like the gold-colored, swoop-roofed
                Berliner Philharmonie, built in 1963. <BR>

        <h2>Things to do</h2>
        <div align="left">


            <p><h3>Brandenburg Gate</h3></p>

            <p><img src="images/BrandenburgGate.jpg" alt="berlin" style="width:200px;height:200px;margin-right:15px;">
                <BR>
                <BR>
                Berlin's most famous historic landmark is the Brandenburg Gate (Brandenburger Tor), once a symbol of a
                divided nation and now a symbol of unity and peace.
                <BR>
                This Neoclassical gate was commissioned by King Frederick Wilhelm II in 1788, and its design was
                inspired by the Propylaea in Athens' Acropolis.
                <BR>
                The sandstone monument is 26 meters tall, standing in the Mitte district's Pariser Platz, just a block
                from the Reichstag building. During the Cold War, its physical and symbolic position as a blocked gate
                along the Berlin Wall made it a frequent site for demonstrations by West Berliners, and it is famous for
                being the backdrop of US President Ronald Reagan's 1987 entreaty to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to
                tear down the wall.
                <BR>
                It was also the scene of a poignant gesture when German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russia's Mikhail
                Gorbachev, and Poland's Lech Walesa walked through the gate in 1999 to commemorate the tearing down of
                the Berlin Wall 20 years earlier.</p>

            <p><h3>Museum Island</h3></p>

            <p><img src="images/Museumisland.jpg" alt="berlin" style="width:200px;height:200px;margin-right:15px;">
                <BR>
                Between the River Spree and the Kupfergraben in a 400-meter-long canal, Spree Island is better known as
                Museum Island (Museumsinsel), a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Here, you'll find many of the city's oldest
                and most important museums, including the Old Museum (Altes Museum), built in 1830 to house the Crown
                Jewels and other royal treasures.
                <BR>
                The New Museum (Neues Museum), destroyed during WWII, was rebuilt and opened again in 2009 as the home
                of extensive collections from the Egyptian Museum, the Papyrus Collection, and the Collection of
                Classical Antiquities.
                <BR>
                <BR>
                The Old National Gallery (Alte Nationalgalerie), opened in 1876, displays Neoclassical sculpture and
                paintings from 1815-1848, as well as Impressionist and early Modernist pieces.
                <BR>
                The Bode Museum houses a collection of Byzantine art, as well as a large sculpture collection spanning
                from medieval times to the late 1700s.
                <BR>
                The city's most popular museum, the Pergamon features a Museum of Islamic Art, the Ishtar Gate, and
                reconstructed historic buildings from the Middle East.

            <p><h3>The Berlin Wall Memorial and Checkpoint Charlie</h3></p>

            <p><img src="images/berlin-wall.jpg" alt="berlin" style="width:200px;height:200px;margin-right:15px;">
                <BR>
                The Berlin Wall originated in 1961 when East Germany sealed off that half of the city to prevent citizens from fleeing to West Germany.
                <BR>
                By the time it was torn down in 1989, the four-meter-high wall extended 155 kilometers, dissected 55 streets, and possessed 293 observation towers and 57 bunkers.
                <BR>
                Today, only small stretches of this graffiti-covered travesty remain, including a 1.4-kilometer stretch preserved as part of the Berlin Wall Memorial, a chilling reminder of the animosity that once divided Europe.
                <BR>
                Highlights include the Marienfelde Refugee Center Museum with its exhibits relating to the one-and-a-half million people who passed through Berlin as refugees, the Monument in Memory of the Divided City and the Victims of Communist Tyranny,
                <BR>
                the Window of Remembrance, and a Visitor Center with views over the remains of the wall.
                <BR>
                Also of interest is Museum Haus am Checkpoint Charlie marking the best-known crossing point between East and West Berlin and with displays and artifacts tracing the history of human rights.
